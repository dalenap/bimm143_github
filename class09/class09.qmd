Today we will take a step back to some data we can taste and explore the correlation structure and principal components of some Halloween candy.

## Data Import

```{r}
candy <- read.csv("candy-data.csv", row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

>Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

>Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it's winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Sour Patch Kids",]$winpercent
```

>Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

>Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```

## Exploratory Analysis

We can use the **skimr** package to get a quick overview of a given dataset. This can be useful for the first time you encounter a new dataset.

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

>Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

>> It looks like the last column `candy$winpercent` is on a different scale to all others. 

>Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

>> A zero represents a false and a one represents true. For candy$chocolate, it gives a one to candies that apply and are/have chocolate. The columns indicate if a given candy has a given feature.

>Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent)+
  geom_histogram(bins = 10,fill="aquamarine3")
```

>Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

>> Not symmetrical from the histogram.

>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```
>> The median is below 50.

>Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
choc.inds  <- candy$chocolate == 1
choc.candy <-candy[ choc.inds,]
choc.win   <-choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```
```{r}
fruit.win <- candy[as.logical(candy$fruity),]$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```
>> Chocolate candy is higher ranked than fruit candy on average.

>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
ans <- t.test(choc.win,fruit.win)
```

>> Yes with a P-value of `r ans$p.value`.

## 3. Overall Candy Rankings

>Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

There are two related functions that can help here, one is the classic `sort()` and `order()`

```{r}
x <- c(5,10,1,4)
sort(x,decreasing =T)
```
```{r}
order(x)
```
```{r}
indsleast <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[indsleast,],5)
```

>> Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble & Jawbusters.

>Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent,decreasing = T)
head(candy[inds,],5)

```
>> Reese's Peanut Butter cup, Reese's Miniatures, Twix, Kit Kat, Snikcers.

Make a bar plot with ggplot and order it by `winpercent` values.

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on `winpercent` values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent,rownames(candy))+
  geom_col()
```
>Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent,reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent))+
  geom_col()
```

Here we want a custom color vector to color each bar the way we want -- with `chocolate` and `fruity` candy together whether it is a `bar` or not.

```{r}

my_cols=rep("grey39", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "dodgerblue4"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "darkmagenta"

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width=4,height=7.5)
```
![My silly barplot image](mybarplot.png)

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

>> Sixlets.

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

>> Starbust.

## 4. Winpercent vs Pricepercent

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 6)+
  theme_bw()
```

>Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

>Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

## 5. Correlation Structure

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)

corrplot(cij)
```

>Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

>> Chocolate and fruit are negatively correlated.

```{r}
round(cij["chocolate","fruity"],2)
```

>Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

```{r}
round(cij["bar","chocolate"],2)
```

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We need to be sure to scale our input `candy` data before PCA as we have the `winpercent` column on a different scale to all others in the dataset.

```{r}
pca <-prcomp(candy,scale=T)
summary(pca)
```

First main result figure is my "PCA plot"

```{r}
ggplot(pca$x) + 
  aes(PC1, PC2,label=rownames(pca$x))+
  geom_point(col=my_cols)+
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 7,col=my_cols)+
  labs(title = "PCA1 vs PCA2")
  theme_bw()
```

The second main PCA result is in the `pcca$rotation`we can plot this to generate a so-called "loadings" plot.

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation)+
  aes(PC1,reorder(rownames(pca$rotation),PC1),fill=PC1)+
  geom_col()
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

>> Fruity and pluribus are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction. This does make sense as people
